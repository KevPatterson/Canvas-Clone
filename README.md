This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

### Stickers Integration
The application now includes a stickers feature that integrates with the Freepik API to provide users with a wide variety of stickers and icons. Users can:

- Search for stickers using keywords
- Browse through sticker categories
- Add stickers directly to the canvas
- Resize and position stickers on the design
- Use fallback stickers when the API is unavailable

The stickers feature is accessible through the Elements section with a dedicated "Stickers" tab alongside the existing "Formas" (Shapes) tab.
